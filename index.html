            <h2 class="heading">What is sign language?</h2>
                <p class="description">American Sign Language (ASL) is a language that only uses your hands and face expressions to send a message. Sign language is used by people who are deaf or who are hard of hearing. To make sure you give the right message in sign language, the way you move your hands and body are extremely important. American Sign Language has its own word order, grammar, rules for punctuation, and accent just like a regular speaking language. Different countries have their own sign language. That means sign language in one country is different in other countries.</p>
            <h2 class="heading">Importance of ASL</h2>
            <p class="description">Knowing ASL is very important. It creates more opportunities for you to talk to those who are deaf or hard of hearing. It makes you know more of the deaf community and culture. Also, knowing ASL can be help in a job. Not a lot of people know ASL, so when an employer knows you know ASL, you have a better chance. It helps you in life, just like knowing a second speaking language does.
