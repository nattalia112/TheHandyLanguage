                    <p class="description">For this site we want to teach and show the importance of the basics of ASL. We want our users to be able to have a simple conversation with someone who speaks sign language. We want not only adults but children to learn ASL. Learning any language at a young age is easier than later in life. Children should understand that there are people who canâ€™t verbally speak and use sign language.</p>

                    <p class="index_title">What is ASL?</p>
                    <p class="description">American Sign Language (ASL) is a language that only uses your hands and facial expressions to send a message. Sign language is used by people who are deaf or hard of hearing. In sign language, the way you move your hands and body are extremely important. Each country has their own sign language and there is no universal sign language. </p>

                    <p class="index_title">Importance of ASL</p>
                    <p class="description">Knowing ASL is very important. It creates more opportunities to talk to those who are deaf or hard of hearing. Also, knowing ASL can be helpful while getting a job. Not a lot of people know ASL, so when an employer knows that you know ASL, you have a better chance. Also, it helps you in life as well, just like knowing a second speaking language does.</p>

                    <p class="index_title">History of ASL</p>
                    <p class="description">ASL was founded by Dr. Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet in 1814. He meet a little girl who was deaf and wanted to help her. He raised money for her to go to school and learn french sign language.  As more people were becoming deaf he wanted to make an American sign language for people so they could understand each other.  </p>
